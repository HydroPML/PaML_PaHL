# PaML_PaHL
PaHL directly combines pure physics-based models, such as numerical methods, climate, land, hydrology, and Earth system models, with ML models. According to the hybrid way, hybrid learning can be divided into serial, parallel, and complex ways of approaching learning. 
# Different hybrid approaches in physics-aware hybrid learning.
